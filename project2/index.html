	<h1>The Soul Selects Her Own Soceity</h1>
<body>
	<p>By <b>Emily Dickinson</b></p>
	<p>The soul selects her own society<br>
		<br>
		Then shuts the door; <br>
		<br>
		On her divine majority, <br>
		<br>
		Obtrude no more. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing <br>
		<br>
		At heer low gate; <br>
		<br>
		Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling <br>
		<br>
		Upon her mat. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I've known her from an ample nation <br>
		<br>
		Choose one; <br>
		<br>
		Then close the valves of her attention <br>
		<br>
		Like stone.
