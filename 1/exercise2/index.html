<h1>Steps</h1>

	<h2><div id="1">1. Wash your face twice each day, once in the morning and again at night.</h2>
		<p>You don't want that crusty skin on your face. After washing your face, apply a light moisturizer so your skin will be soft and your makeup will apply evenly. </p>

	<h2><div id="2">2. Only use concealer if necessary.</h2>
		 <p>While most guides instruct you to apply concealer after your foundation, but in some cases you can look like you have bags under your eyes. You can use concealer on under eye circles and pimples. </p>

	<h2><div id="3">3. Get a color a little lighter than your skin tone. </h2>
		 <p>Don't rub it on but dab it or pat it on and blend it in well.</p>

	<h2><div id="4">4. Use a liquid foundation, if you have blotchy skin.</h2>
		  <p>If you have pretty even skin, use a tinted moisturizer. To apply liquid foundation get a little palette such as the top of my eyeshadow case. Dab your make up sponge in the foundation and apply to the middle of your forehead. Work the color toward the sides of you forehead. Do the same starting with your nose, chin and cheeks. If needed to blend it in, you can use a cloth like an old t-shirt.</p>

	<h2><div id="5">Set in your foundation powder.</h2>
		  <p>Simply brush or pat it on.</p>
<img src="image/6.jpg">
	<h2><div id="6">6. Apply your brush.</h2>
		  <p>If you want a beachy tan look get the big brush you used for powder. Lightly brush it in bronzer and apply evenly to skin. Don't add too much or your face will look darker than your neck.</p>
<img src="image/7.jpg">
	<h2><div id="7">7. If you want a rosy glow, find a peachy or rosy looking blush and smile.</h2>
		  <p>Very lightly apply to the apple of your cheeks while smiling.</p>
<img src="image/8.jpg">
	<h2><div id="8">8. Enhance your eyes using Eyeliner.</h2>
		  <p>- Set your elbow somewhere solid, put your finger a little below your eye, and pull down gently.<br>
		  	 - Put the eyeliner lightly on the line. Black is always cute but brown and gray are good choices too. You're enhancing, here.<br>
		  	 - Don't go bold.<br>
